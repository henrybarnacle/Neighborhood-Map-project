# Neighborhood Map Project
#### For Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree project 5

An app to display a map of a neighborhood, with markers for several locations and a side-menu with a list of those locations. 

I have chosen **Williamsburg,** **Brooklyn** as the neighborhood and a happy-hour themed map 
showing bars I regularly frequent. The app and map itsef is styled with
a nightime theme to reflect this.

The app is repsonsive and is fully-functional on modbile devices and laptop/desktops.

The build incorporates **bootstrap** for responsive design, **knockout.js**, **jquery**, the **Google maps 
API** and **Foursquare API**.

The side-menu contains a search bar which filters the list item and markers by name.
List items are clickable. Clicking on a lst item opens an info window for the relevant
marker (as does clicking on the marker itself).

When opened, the info windows contain information from Foursquare's venue api about each location, 
currently the  name of location, whether location is currently open for business, an image, 
approximate price and the address.
